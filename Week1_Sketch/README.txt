Week 1 Sketch

1. The gridsketch folder contains processing file with sketch based on lab content related
to grids, particularly based on 2_diceroll.

This code maintains the essence of a grid by creating rectangles that start
(upper-left corner) from points equal distance apart but may be different sizes
that extend beyond a typical square grid's constraints. The user must click to
activate each roll, which results in a random rectangle based on four different
options.

2. The exampleoutputs sub-folder includes screenshots of some outputs of my sketch.

3. The classexercise.PNG is included as well. My instructions can be read above
the sketch completed by Dennis. He did a better job with my instructions better
than when I followed his. :)
