Week 4 Sketch

I used PVectors and grids to try and create an interactive game with a defined objective, allowing the player to win or lose.

INSTRUCTIONS

Your cursor location controls a circle-and-point's location, while your mouse button helps you control the size of the circle.
Use both to line your circle up with the yellow target circles to gain points.
You win after 10 points, or you lose when time runs out!
